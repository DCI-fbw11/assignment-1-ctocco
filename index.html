        <p>
            <strong> A new report shows</strong>
            <br>
            <br> In the rapidly warming Antarctic, two species of penguins are in dramatic decline.
            <br>
            <br> That’s the news out of a new study published by Oceanites, a nonprofit organization that closely monitors penguins
            and other
            <span style="color:red;">Antarctic seabirds</span>, in collaboration with researchers from NASA and Stony Brook University in New York.
            <br>
            <br> Relying on satellite photos and on-the-ground analysis from more than 660 sites across the frozen continent,
            the study paints a broad picture of the health of several Antarctic penguin species: the Adélie, chinstrap, emperor,
            and gentoo. Like endangered
            <a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarbears" target="_blank">polar bears</a>, penguins have come to represent vulnerability in the face of rapidly unfolding
            <a style="text-decoration: none" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/climatechange" target="_blank">climate change.</a>
            <br>
            <br> The report looked specifically at the Antarctic Peninsula, which has warmed by a year-round average of 5 degrees
            Fahrenheit in the past 60 years. There, two species — Adélie and chinstrap penguins — were reported to be in
            severe decline. Meanwhile, gentoo penguins appeared to be adapting to changing circumstances.</p>
